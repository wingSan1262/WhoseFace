# WhoseFace (TFLite Face Recognize)

About Whose Face.

Whose Face is side research and studies on tensorflow lite model utilization
This app recycle the base TF Lite Utilization class from existing code.
Basically it used an existing trained model of TFLite ML model.
Therefore we have to provide exact data the model trained.
This done to obtained the accuracy of model of predicting face.
Although the data set for recognizing new face only few,
but decent classification can be obtained.

This work of app is recyling the existing work of Esteban Uri.

Whose Face Alpha (V 1.0.0 1001)

About BadCode.

BadCode is just a developer name for me to name the app study.
BadCode is obtained through sloppy design and lack of maintainability of the code.
the code of the app complexity should limited to low and medium.
Each of app is developed on purposed to be developed/combined into other functionality

Congratulation, you are using the very first app seriously built by BadCode.
For code sharing will shared in GitHub.com later on Alpha 3 (1003).

Cheers ...

Btw, press back to see setting screen again. I kinda hate action bar back button.


# How to operate

How to operate is first use you need to train on some face first, then you can star recognize
